# BivariateEMProbit
This repository has the function and examples to run the Bivariate and Univariate Probit using the EM-Algorithm applied in Bioinformatics.

The emoneProbitf.py is the function to univariate Probit calculated with EM algorithm with multivariate X predictor.

The embiprobit.py is the function to bivariate Probir calculated with EM algorithm with multivariate X predictor.

The sample_green.py is one ejecution using the file ejemplo_greenvf.csv, the result is show in screen. The constant is agregated in X with function X = sm.add_constant(X, prepend=False).
